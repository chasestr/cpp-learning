- C++ code is compiled into machine/object code, and the resulting files are linked using a linker. 
    ^- The output of the linker is an executable file.
    ^- Object code and executable files are NOT portable among systems. When you compile for a Windows machine, you get object code that would not be able to run on a Linux machine.
- Errors found by the compiler are compile-time errors.
- Errors found by the linker are called link-time errors.
- Errors not found until the program is run are called run-time or logic errors.
- A function has four parts:
    ^- A return type
    ^- A name
    ^- A parameter list
    ^- A function body
